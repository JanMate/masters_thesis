\section{Usability testing}\label{sec:usability-testing}

This section talks about usability testing what is phase in the User interface design cycle.
This phase involves testing with user who gets instruction by a scenario, and the task is to do it in his natural way.
The main purpose of this testing is detection of bad design elements and determination of the arrangement mistakes.
The elements can be arranged in a screen, part of a screen, menu or drop-down menu.
It depends on the purpose of concrete used application.

At first, we designed the Hi-Fi prototype by the concurrent applications and we tried to learn from their design mistakes.
We had to decide if it is better to place a sliding panel with advisories on Dashboard or an animated button for a flight planning, how should look the profile menu screen and its icon or if it is useful to pin a place into the map.
After that we have organized the usability testing with common people who could be our potential customers.

During the testing we were detecting a few essential mistakes in the design.
They are closely described in following subsection Results \ref{subsec:results}.

\subsection{Results}\label{subsec:results}
This part contains a feed back from usability testing.
We have attended two usability testing.
The first one was in the beginning of the mobile application development.
The other one was before the release of the alpha version of this application.
The following paragraphs are related to the second usability testing.

We have tested with 6 users.
One of them was from Faculty of transportation sciencies, the others were my colleagues from Faculty of information technology.
Many of them were bachelor students, so it means they are between 20 and 25 of age.
The Faculty of transportation sciences' student gave me an insight what would expect a user with flight knowledge.
He describes me how should behave the map on the Dashboard and how I understand various map layers and flight levels.
My Faculty's colleagues were in the role of common users and helped me to understand what they expect of the used elements in the screens.
For the briefness, I chose three of them.
Due to GDPR, I anonymized their name.

Person One:
\begin{itemize}
    \item %Todo
\end{itemize}
Person Two:
\begin{itemize}
    \item %Todo
\end{itemize}
Person Three:
\begin{itemize}
    \item %Todo
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Main mistakes in UI design}\label{subsec:main-mistakes-in-ui-design}
During the usability testing we discovered the interesting findings that are described in this section.
We expected some of them.
Some of them surprised us and were forcing to consider a change in User interface.
For example, we found out that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item it is not as so much intuitive as the users expect the searching drones and devices from Search button.
    The user expects only searching places, whereas it is a part of Dashboard where the map si the key element.
    \item it is not sure the bottom panel is possible pull up.
    So, it is one of the reasons, why we decided to omit the bottom sliding up panel with advisories so far.
    The other one, is it is not known and approved the final legislation so far, and it is still in progress.
    \item the assigning of the drone to the device is not so useful.
    It is better to allow a user to set a default device and default drone, and allow the user to change them when he is planning flight.
    \item a user appreciates an option to move with the map in the In-flight screen.
\end{enumerate}
This knowledge has had a huge impact to changing screens to reach better user's perception.
