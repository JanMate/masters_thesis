\subsection{Flight Screens}\label{subsec:flight-screens}
The Flights screen~(Figure~\ref{fig:flights}) is for displaying a list of the flights.
This screen contains flight statistics and allows finding certain flights by chosen filters.
By every flight, it shows its state if it is planned and current flight, planned start and finish dates, and a map with the flight telemetry.
Besides, it contains the button for exporting the whole flight history.
If users choose a planned flight, it shows the Flight plan screen, which is a planned flight summary and consists of various parameters.
It is possible to show the Flight detail screen for finished flights, and the In-flight detail screen for current flights.

The Flight detail screen contains all information about a flight, including the option to replay flight trajectory from start to the end.
The In-flight detail screen contains information about the flight in real-time.
Thanks to the Sliding up panel the user is able to see more information and still check if a drone did not escape the reservation area.

The Plan a flight is a group of three screens that represent a wizard for flight plan.
In the first screen, the users set identification properties and planned time of the flight.
In the second screen, the users set a polygon or circle for the planned flight and its maximum altitude.
In the last screen, the users confirm set parameters of the planned flight - it is like a summary.
