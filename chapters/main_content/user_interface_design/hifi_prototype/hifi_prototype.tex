\section{Hi-Fi Prototype}\label{sec:hi-fi-prototype}
This section consists of screens in the application with a detailed description of their elements.
The \acrshort{hifi} prototype was made by Marian Hlav{\' a}{\v c} in Adobe XD~\cite{adobeXD} and is available online~\cite{hifiPrototype}.
It was emphasized to the simplicity and briefness and kept the focus on the essential \acrshort{ui} and \acrshort{ux} design rules.
These rules are based on "Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design".~\cite{nnGroup}
It describes key aspects of User Interface Design.
The heuristics by Jakob Nielsen are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Visibility of system status,
    \item Match between system and the real world,
    \item User control and freedom,
    \item Consistency and standards,
    \item Error prevention,
    \item Recognition rather than recall,
    \item Flexibility and efficiency of use,
    \item Aesthetic and minimalist design,
    \item Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors,
    \item Help and documentation.
\end{enumerate}

Applications built on these heuristics will be successful and useful because these heuristics are based on various psychological researches and usability testing with ordinary users.
