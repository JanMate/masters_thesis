\section{Hi-Fi prototype}\label{sec:hi-fi-prototype}
This section consists of screens in the application with detailed description of their elements.
We made a Hi-Fi prototype in Adobe XD.
We emphasized to the simplicity and briefness and keep focus on the most important rules of design UI and UX.
These rules are based on Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design.\cite{nnGroup}
It describes key aspects of User interface design.
The heuristics by Jakob Nielsen are following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Visibility of system status,
    \item Match between system and the real world,
    \item User control and freedom,
    \item Consistency and standards,
    \item Error prevention,
    \item Recognition rather than recall,
    \item Flexibility and efficiency of use,
    \item Aesthetic and minimalist design,
    \item Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors and
    \item Help and documentation.\cite{nnGroup}
\end{enumerate}

The applications built on these heuristics will be successful and useful because these heuristics are based on various psychological researches and usability testing with common users.
