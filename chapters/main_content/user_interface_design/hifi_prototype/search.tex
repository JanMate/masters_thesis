\subsection{Search Screen}\label{subsec:search-screen}
The \textbf{Opened Search screen} is the first what users see when they click on the Search button in the \textbf{Dashboard}.
It shows recent results that the users have searched in the last time.
The result can be a drone, aircraft, place or zone.

If users use the \textbf{Search text field} and types a text string, it will show them a result with an icon for better identification.
If users choose an item in the list of results, it will redirect them to any of the Detail screens.
The screen can be either the \textbf{Aircraft detail screen}, the \textbf{Device detail screen}, or a place on the map in the \textbf{Dashboard}.
After choosing that item, it will appear in the list of the \textbf{Recent} results.
