\subsection{Search screen}\label{subsec:search-screen}
The \textbf{Opened Search screen} is the first what a user see when he clicks on the Search button in the \textbf{Dashboard}.
It shows recent results that the user has searched in the last time.
The result can be a drone, aircraft, place or zone.

If a user uses the \textbf{Search text field} and types a text string, it will show him a result with an icon for better identification.
If a user chooses an item in the list of results, it redirects him to a Detail screen.
The screen can be either the \textbf{Aircraft detail} screen or the \textbf{Device detail} screen, or even a place in the map in the \textbf{Dashboard}.
After choosing that item, it will appear in the list of the \textbf{Recent} results.
