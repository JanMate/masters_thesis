\subsection{Search screen}\label{subsec:search-screen}
\textbf{Opened Search screen} is the first what a user see when he clicks on the Search button in \textbf{Dashboard}.
It shows recent results that user has searched at the last time.
The result can be a drone, aircraft, place or zone.

If a user uses \textbf{Search text field} and type a text string, it will show to him a result with an icon for better identification.
If a user choose an item in the list of results, it redirects him to either to \textbf{Aircraft detail} or \textbf{Device detail}, or even a place in the map in \textbf{Dashboard}.
After choosing that item, it will appear in the list of \textbf{Recent} results.
