\chapter{User Interface Design}\label{ch:user-interface-design}
This chapter is focused on the \textbf{User Interface Design} of the Dronetag mobile application.
It starts with an explanation of difference between \textbf{UI} (User Interface) and \textbf{UX} (User Experience), and continues with a description about the user interface structure of this application.
So, it contains a list of screens that are shown to users when the users go through the application.

The main difference between \textbf{UI} and \textbf{UX} is in the approach.
\textbf{UI} approach emphasizes a combination of visual elements such that the final concept of visualization fits together.
\textbf{UX} approach emphasizes an arrangement of these visual elements such that their arrangement was logical, and it was close to human thinking.~\cite{prototyping}
There are many visual elements.
They can be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a text field,
    \item a checkbox,
    \item a List view,
    \item a text label,
    \item an icon,
    \item an image,
    \item and others.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{UI} approach deals with their skin~-~for example, a color, size, shadow, border, shape, and others.
\textbf{UX} approach focuses on the size and position on the screen.
The arrangement of elements in screens should be comprehensive and should make sense to users.

The \textbf{User Interface Design} phase usually includes \textbf{Lo-Fi} (Low Fidelity) and \textbf{Hi-Fi} (High Fidelity) prototyping.~\cite{effectivePrototyping}
There will be clarified the difference between them.
\textbf{Lo-Fi}, how the name hints, is a simplified sketch without colors with a purpose to incorporate the elements on a screen together.
It is cheaper than \textbf{Hi-Fi} and takes only a few hours to finish.
The benefits are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item focus on design and concepts,
    \item focus on design and concepts,
    \item accessible to everyone.~\cite{hiFiLoFiPrototypeArticle}
\end{itemize}

In opposite, \textbf{Hi-Fi}, how the name hints, includes a fidelity design that should correspond to the final product.
It is more expensive than {\textbf{Lo-Fi} and usually takes a few days.
The benefits are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item More familiar to users,
    \item Pinpoint specific components to test,
    \item More presentable to stakeholders.~\cite{hiFiLoFiPrototypeArticle}
\end{itemize}
To more information about fidelity, anyone can read this article~\cite{hiFiLoFiPrototypeArticle}.

\textbf{Lo-Fi} prototype has not been created because Dronetag is Start-up, a company with a limited budget, so there is only the \textbf{Hi-Fi} prototype.
When \textbf{Hi-Fi} was being made, it was inspired by a few competitor applications, which show permitted flight zones and danger areas.
These applications are described in the Related projects chapter~\ref{ch:related-projects}, so they will not be discussed anymore.
