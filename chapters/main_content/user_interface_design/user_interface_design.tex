\chapter{User interface design}\label{ch:user-interface-design}
This chapter is focused to User interface design of Dronetag mobile application.
It starts with explaination what is \textbf{UI} and \textbf{UX} and describes the reasons why we decided to design the application as we did.

The main difference between \textbf{UI} (User Interface) and \textbf{UX} (User Experience) is in the approach.
\textbf{UI} approach emphasizes to a combination of visual elements such that the final concept of visualization fits together.
\textbf{UX} approach emphasizes to an arrangement of these visual elements such that their arrangement was logical and it was so close to the human thinking.
There is a huge number of visual elements.
It can be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a text field,
    \item a checkbox,
    \item a List view,
    \item a text label,
    \item an icon,
    \item an image,
    \item and so on.
\end{itemize}

UI approach solves their skin.
For example, a color, size, shadow, border, shape, and so on.

UX approach focuses on the size and position on screen.
The arrangement of elements in a screen should be comprehensive and should make sense.

In User interface design phase are usually used \textbf{Lo-Fi} (Low fidelity) and \textbf{Hi-Fi} (High fidelity) prototypes.
Let me clarify what is the difference between them.
\textbf{Lo-Fi}, how the name hints, is a simplified sketch without colors with a purpose to incorporate the elements on a screen together.
It is cheaper than \textbf{Hi-Fi} and takes only a few hours to finish.
The benefits are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item focus on design and concepts,
    \item focus on design and concepts and
    \item accessible to everyone.\cite{hiFiLoFiPrototypeArticle}
\end{itemize}

In opposite, \textbf{Hi-Fi}, how the name hints, includes a fidelity design that should correspond to the final product.
It is more expensive than {\textbf{Lo-Fi} and usually takes a few days.
The benefits are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item More familiar to users,
    \item Pinpoint specific components to test and
    \item More presentable to stakeholders.\cite{hiFiLoFiPrototypeArticle}
\end{itemize}
To more information about fidelity you can read this article \cite{hiFiLoFiPrototypeArticle}.

I did no Lo-Fi prototype because Dronetag is Start-up, company with limit budget, so I focused only on the Hi-Fi.
When I was making Hi-Fi, I inspired by a few concurrency application, which shows permitted flight zones and danger areas.
These applications are described in chapter Related projects \ref{ch:related-projects} so I will not mention them anymore.

Write about techniques and reasons to concentrate on these things.
