%TODO: Describe a difference between Lo-Fi and Hi-Fi prototype.

I did not a Lo-Fi prototype because Dronetag is Start-up, company with limit budget, so I focused only on the Hi-Fi.
When I was making Hi-Fi, I inspired by a few concurrency application, which shows permitted flight zones and danger areas.
These application are described in chapter Related projects \ref{ch:related-projects} so I will not mention them anymore.

%todo: Describe a difference between UI and UX .
Write about techniques and reasons to concentrate on these things.
