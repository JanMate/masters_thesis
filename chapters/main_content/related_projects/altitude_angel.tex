\section{Altitude Angel}\label{sec:altitude-angel}
Altitude Angel ecosystem is able to divide into some branches:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Guardian UTM,
    \item Guardian Mobile and
    \item Drone Safety Map.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{GuardianUTM}\label{subsec:guardianutm}
There is only one way to get information on the official documentation.\cite{altitudeAngel}


\subsection{Drone Safety Map}\label{subsec:drone-safety-map}
It is a mobile and web application for drone pilots connected to GuardianUTM. Its goal is to show zones and flight missions of all pilots.

Advantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The application shows flight zones in all countries.
    \item Except zones, it also shows hazard objects like high-voltage wires, schools, police offices, gas stations.
    Maybe, it is crowded of information and map data was not clear.
    \item It supports CAA UK, that integrates their solution into the application NATS Drone Assist.
\end{itemize}
Disadvantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The registration is pain with additional password setting via e-mail.
    \item The flight plan creating contains annoyed text fields (flight title, description, timezone).
    The flight plan history does not exist.
    \item There is no change to share telemetries in real time (for example connection with drones DJI).
    \item It does not allow planning of complex zones than circle.
    \item It difficult to determine a reserved zone for flight against restricted zone by the authorities in User Interface.
    \item Completely, the mobile and web application is quite weak with UI beside AirMap.
    For example, it shows terms \& conditions before every flight.
    \item The mobile application has crashed during mission planning and searching, too.
\end{itemize}
