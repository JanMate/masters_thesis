\section{MAIA}\label{sec:maia}
MAIA is an application by the UpVision company that is primarily used for using understandable displaying of flight zones such that a user will not be in trouble.\cite{maia}

The user interface is primarily created by the map that contains flight zones and restrictions.
In case of sufficient data, it can see the location of real-time drones in the map and their details about aircraft in the airspace.

The signed up user can have a summary of his drones, battery status and flight history.
Every user can contact another user, that is visible in the map.
This function is called Messenger.
A user can add an insurance confirmation, pilot certification and permission for flight operations in the application.
It seems like useless functionality.
Users can share their favorite flight location.

The application of the enterprise version promises functions for drone fleet owners, such as Geofencing, central management, drone detection and collision detection.

Advantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The application shows drones' positions in real-time.
    \item The application shows flight zones and restrictions.
    \item The application provides data about flight zones in other countries than only the Czech Republic.
\end{itemize}
Disadvantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The web platform has not as many functions as at all.
    It can sign in, but it contains no map data.
    The application is useless without the MAIA tracker.
    \item The mobile application contains many bugs and is not up-to-date.
\end{itemize}
