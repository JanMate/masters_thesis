\section{AisView}\label{sec:aisview}
AisView (or its simplified DroneView) is an application created Air Navigation Service of the Czech Republic for before starting flight purposes.
There are restrictions, map zones, NOTAMs (Notice To Airmen) and planned drone flights in the map.
It has no real time drone location data.

A user sets flight a time range (from and to), and after he will be able to see relevant information related to him in the map during the time range.
In addition, a user must manually click to shown zones to see more information.

A user can the map cover with additional information with weather (especially a layer of data from CHMI radar) or choose a type of map data (ICAO, orto, tourist).

The user interface is quite unfriendly and non-intuitive in some cases.
The buttons are sometimes labeled by abbreviations, and it is certain the application is rather for professionals.
A layman can have problems with this application and does not have to understand its possibilities.
Neither the DronView is not so better than the AisView.

After logging in a user can add registration numbers of his devices and announce drone flight plans.
In addition, there are options to store various minor map showing preferences and other details for logged user.

AisView primarily provides especially a web variant, that is able to use on the computer and mobile phones.
There is a variant for mobile phones, too.
However it is quite limited and looks obsolete and does not include all system functions.
