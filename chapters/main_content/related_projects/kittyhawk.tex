Advantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It allows limited manner support for DJI drones flights (for example, live stream).
    \item There are many map data and user-friendly map layer filtering.
    \item Moving across the map and searching in zones is more user-friendly than in other applications.
    \item It shows anonymous live traffic on the map.
    \item There are well-arranged UI reports, that can be exported.
\end{itemize}
Disadvantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It displays zones only in the USA, it shows no zones in the EU.
    \item It loads all data related to flights from \textbf{AirMap} (map data, weather, authorization).
    \item The registration takes a long time and requires a phone number.
    It does not support Google account login.
    \item UI is not entirely intuitive.
    For example, if users want to plan a flight and have not added a drone yet, they can see only a blank screen and cannot add the flight plan.
\end{itemize}
