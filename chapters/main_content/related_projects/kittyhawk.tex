\section{Kittyhawk}\label{sec:kittyhawk}
Kittyhawk is a mobile and web application that has similar functionality like MAIA, but its functionality has finished.
All flight operations and rules are as similar as AirMap, except User Interface.
Bonus is the fleet management, checklists and battery management.

Advantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It supports DJI drones flights, but only in the limited mode (for example, live stream).
    \item There are many map data and good map layer filtering.
    \item Moving across the map and searching in zones is smooth enough.
    I have never seen it before in other applications.
    \item It shows anonymous live traffic on the map.
    \item There are beautiful UI reports, where can export data.
\end{itemize}
Disadvantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It runs only in the USA. It shows no zones in the EU.
    \item It loads all data related to flights from AirMap (map data, weather, authorization).
    \item The registration takes a long time and requires a phone number.
    It does not support Google account login.
    \item UI is not entirely intuitive.
    For example, if I want to plan a flight and have not added a drone yet, I can see only a blank screen and cannot add it.
\end{itemize}
