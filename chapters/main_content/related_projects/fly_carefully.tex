\section{Fly Carefully (L{\' e}tejte zodpov{\v e}dn{\v e})}\label{sec:fly-carefully}
\textbf{Fly Carefully} is an educational website whose main purpose is to educate hobby drone pilots and gets them to know with valid regulation.
Rules for flying with drones describe precisely and offer help to total beginners.
This website is managed by the \textbf{Air Navigation Service of the Czech Republic} what is the state organization ensuring aviation safety.~\cite{flyCarefully}
It is divided into seven basic sections:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Introduction - it contains important advisories for flights,
    \item My drone - it is a section about drone categories and types,
    \item Plan your flight - it gets to know readers about options to plan a flight,
    \item Our application - it introduces a secondary product what a mobile application is,
    \item Regulation - it informs readers about valid flight regulations and advisories,
    \item Actualities - it represents news feeds,
    \item Registration - it provides a form to subscribe to newsletters.
\end{enumerate}
This mobile application is similar to the \textbf{AirMap} application because it uses the \textbf{AirMap} public API and it offers nothing new against the \textbf{AirMap} mobile application.
