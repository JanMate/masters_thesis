It is divided into 7 basic sections:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Introduction} - it contains important advisories for flights,
    \item \textbf{My drone} - it is a section about drone categories and types,
    \item \textbf{Plan your flight} - it gets to know readers about options to plan a flight,
    \item \textbf{Our application} - it introduces a secondary product what a mobile application is,
    \item \textbf{Regulation} - it informs readers about valid flight regulations and advisories,
    \item \textbf{Actualities} - it represents news feeds,
    \item \textbf{Registration} - it provides a form to subscribe to newsletters.

This mobile application is similar to the AirMap application because it uses the AirMap public \acrshort{api} and it offers nothing new against the AirMap mobile application.
