\section{Build instructions}\label{sec:build-instructions}
The build is divided into main three steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item downloading dependencies via \textit{flutter pub upgrade} command,
    \item launching generating of the classes that creates themselves by the annotation settings via \textit{flutter build -~-runner} command
    \item launching generating APK file for Android via \textit{flutter build release} command and
    \item launching generating APP file for iOS in ios/Runner bundle.
\end{enumerate}
The last two steps can be run concurrently because they are independent of each other.
All this build process allows us to be fully autonomous and connected to \textbf{Continuous Integration} (CI) and \textbf{Continuous Delivery} (CD).
Thanks to this fact, the development speed up all software process, and it does not need any Operators.
The development like this is called \textbf{DevOps} (abbreviation of development and information technology Operations), and now its popularity is increasing because of saving time and money.
