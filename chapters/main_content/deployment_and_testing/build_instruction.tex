\section{Build Instructions}\label{sec:build-instructions}
The build is divided into main 4 steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item downloading dependencies via \textbf{flutter pub get} command,
    \item launching generating of the classes that creates themselves by the annotation settings via \textbf{flutter pub run build\_runner} command
    \item launching generating \acrshort{apk} file for Android via \textbf{flutter build apk \newline\texttt{-{}-}release} command and
    \item launching generating APP file for iOS in ios/Runner bundle.
\end{enumerate}

The last two steps can be run concurrently because they are independent of each other.
All this build process allows to be fully autonomous and connected to \acrshort{ci}~(\acrlong{ci}) and \acrshort{cd}~(\acrlong{cd}).
Thanks to this fact, the development speed up the whole software process, and it does not need any information technology operators.
This kind of development is called \acrshort{devops} (abbreviation of development and information technology operations), and now its popularity is increasing because of saving time and money.
