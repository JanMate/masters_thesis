\chapter{Flutter Analysis}\label{ch:flutter-analysis}

This chapter describes the key reasons why Dronetag chose \textbf{Flutter} for mobile application development.

Nowadays, many companies have more teams to maintain their application that ensure the business of these companies.
Thanks to that, the costs are higher than could be, and that is the reason why cross-platform frameworks were created.
There are many cross-platform mobile application platforms to develop an application like this.
The name of the leading used frameworks are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item React Native,
    \item Ionic,
    \item Xamarin.
