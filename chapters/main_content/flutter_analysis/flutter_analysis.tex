\chapter{Analysis of Flutter}\label{ch:analysis-of-flutter}

This chapter describes the key reasons why Dronetag chose Flutter for the mobile application development.

Nowadays, many companies have more teams to maintain their application that ensure the companies' business.
Thanks that the costs are higher than could be and this is the reason why cross-platform frameworks were created.
There are many cross-platform mobile application platforms to develop an application like this.
The name of the main used frameworks are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item React Native,
    \item Ionic and
    \item Xamarin.
\end{itemize}

Flutter is a framework and was established by Google Inc., in 2017 and since that time, its popularity is still increasing.

React Native looks like the main competitor and is based on JavaScript.\cite{flutterVsReactNativeNevercodeIo}
Ionic has not a such good performance like Flutter and React Native.
Xamarin is based on C\# from Microsoft and thus we avoided it.
Flutter is based on Dart which was introduced by Google Inc., in 2011.
It is type safe and object oriented programming language similar to Java.\cite{dartTypeSystem}
Between advantages of Flutter belong:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hot Reload, i.e., allows fast coding,
    \item One codebase: Development for two mobile platforms,
    \item Up to 50\% less testing,
    \item Faster app development,
    \item User-friendly designs,
    \item Perfect for MVPs and
    \item Less Code.\cite{flutterVsReactNativeHackrIo}
\end{itemize}

\section{General concept}\label{sec:general-concept}
"Flutter is an app SDK for building high-performance, high-fidelity apps for iOS, Android, web (beta), and desktop (technical preview) from a single codebase."\cite{flutterTechnicalOverview}
It means you need only one development team to reach an application for all platform in a single codebase.

"The goal is to enable developers to deliver high-performance apps that feel natural on different platforms.
We embrace differences in scrolling behaviors, typography, icons, and more."\cite{flutterTechnicalOverview}

\subsection{Flutter UI}\label{subsec:flutter-ui}
"Flutter includes a modern react-style framework, a 2D rendering engine, ready-made widgets, and development tools.
These components work together to help you design, build, test, and debug apps.
Everything is organized around a few core principles."\cite{flutterTechnicalOverview}
Flutter has a widget tree that renders widget into nested tree, and these widgets are covering themselves.
It does not matter if a widget from the widget tree is Container, List View, Image, Text, Animation or anything else.
Everything is represented by a widget or its descendents.
