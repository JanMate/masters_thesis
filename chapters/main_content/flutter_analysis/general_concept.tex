\section{General concept}\label{sec:general-concept}
"Flutter is an app SDK for building high-performance, high-fidelity apps for iOS, Android, web (beta), and desktop (technical preview) from a single codebase."\cite{flutterTechnicalOverview}
It means you need only one development team to reach an application for all platforms in a single codebase.

"The goal is to enable developers to deliver high-performance apps that feel natural on different platforms.
We embrace differences in scrolling behaviors, typography, icons, and more."\cite{flutterTechnicalOverview}

Thanks to this, we can style our application user interface on demand, and the application looks similar to both platforms.
