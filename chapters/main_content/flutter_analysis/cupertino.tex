\section{Cupertino Library}\label{sec:ios-specific-ui-widgets}
The Flutter developers have decided to incorporate familiar elements from the iOS platform into the library for using these elements in the Flutter user interface.
The reason is that it would be easy to use for development, focusing on iOS devices.
This library calls Cupertino and the name was established by the Apple company headquarters building in Silicon Valley, California, in the United States of America.
Familiar elements from iOS devices are part of the library because the iOS users are using them.~\cite{cupertino}
This library contains the following elements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cupertino Action Sheet,
    \item Cupertino Activity Indicator,
    \item Cupertino Alert Dialog,
    \item Cupertino Button,
