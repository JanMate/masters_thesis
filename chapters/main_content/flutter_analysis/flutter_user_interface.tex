\section{Flutter User Interface}\label{sec:flutter-user-interface}
"Flutter includes a modern react-style framework, a 2D rendering engine, ready-made widgets, and development tools.
These components work together to help you design, build, test, and debug apps.
Everything is organized around a few core principles."~\cite{flutterTechnicalOverview}
Flutter has a widget tree that renders widget into a nested tree, and these widgets are covering themselves.
It does not matter if a widget from the widget tree is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Container,
    \item List View,
    \item Image,
    \item Text,
    \item Animation,
    \item or anything else.
\end{itemize}
A widget or its descendants represent everything in the Flutter user interface.
Additional important classes for user interface are MaterialApp and Scaffold.~\cite{flutterBook}
MaterialApp and Scaffold, it will be described in the Material Design section~\ref{sec:android-specific-ui-widgets}.
