\section{Flutter User Interface}\label{subsec:flutter-user-interface}
"Flutter includes a modern react-style framework, a 2D rendering engine, ready-made widgets, and development tools.
These components work together to help you design, build, test, and debug apps.
Everything is organized around a few core principles."\cite{flutterTechnicalOverview}
Flutter has a widget tree that renders widget into nested tree, and these widgets are covering themselves.
It does not matter if a widget from the widget tree is Container, List View, Image, Text, Animation or anything else.
Everything is represented by a widget or its descendents.
Addition important classes for User Interface are MaterialApp and Scaffold.
MaterialApp and Scaffold we will describe in Android specific UI widgets - Material Design \ref{sec:android-specific-ui-widgets} section.
