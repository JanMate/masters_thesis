\section{Cross-platform Mobile Application Framework Comparison}\label{sec:cross-platform-mobile-application-framework-comparison}
This section describes a comparison of cross-platform mobile application frameworks.
These frameworks are Flutter, React Native, Ionic and Xamarin.

Flutter is a framework and was established by Google Inc., in 2017, and since that time, its popularity is still increasing.
React Native looks like the leading competitor and is based on JavaScript.~\cite{flutterVsReactNativeNevercodeIo}
It means, React Native is widespread and most popular.
Ionic has not such excellent performance as Flutter and React Native.~\cite{crossPlatformFrameworokComparation}
Xamarin is based on C\# with .NET extension from Microsoft.
But since there is a lack of experienced Xamarin developers in the developer community, it was omitted in the Dronetag's decision making.
Flutter is based on Dart, which was introduced by Google Inc., in 2011.
It is a type-safe and object-oriented programming language similar to Java.~\cite{dartTypeSystem}

Among the advantages of Flutter~\cite{flutterVsReactNativeHackrIo} belongs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hot Reload, i.e., allows fast coding,
    \item One codebase: Development for two mobile platforms,
    \item Up to 50~\% less testing,
    \item Faster app development,
    \item User-friendly designs,
    \item Perfect for \acrshort{mvprod}s,
    \item Less Code.
\end{itemize}
There is a comparison summary:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Flutter has the best performance and uses proprietary Widgets to create a user interface instead of \acrshort{html}, \acrshort{css} and JavaScript.
    \item React Native is the most popular because it is based on JavaScript.
    \item 98~\% of code in Ionic is reusable.
    \item Xamarin allows reusing code in Xamarin.Forms, but requires a paid development environment for business purposes.
\end{itemize}
