"Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications."\cite{kubernetes}
It means that \textbf{Kubernetes} is a tool allowing a running cluster whose alone nodes may be as \textbf{docker containers}.
This approach ensures scalability whereas the number of \textbf{docker containers} can be a huge amount, and they can be created and disposed dynamically according to the loading.
The advantage of \textbf{Kubernetes} is it is able to detect a note that is out of order and initialize and deploy a new one to stay the optimal performance.

"It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.
Kubernetes builds upon \textit{15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google} \cite{kubernetesArticle}, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community."\cite{kubernetes}
Thanks these experiences, \textbf{Kubernetes} is fine grain, and the cluster hierarchy is simply maintanable.

"Though widespread interest in software containers is a relatively recent phenomenon, at Google we have been managing Linux containers at scale for more than ten years and built three different container-management systems in that time."\cite{kubernetesArticle}
How you can see, the idea of containerization has a rich history.
But, there were \textbf{Linux Containers} before the \textbf{docker} ones.
This is the reason, why we use it for the web development.
It is easy to scale, maintain and able to deploy to \textbf{Google Cloud Platform}.
