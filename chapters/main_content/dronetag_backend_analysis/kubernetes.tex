"Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications."\cite{kubernetes}
It means that \textbf{Kubernetes} is a tool allowing a running cluster whose single nodes may be as \textbf{docker containers}.
This approach ensures scalability, whereas the number of \textbf{docker containers} can be huge and can be created and disposed of dynamically based on the loading.
The advantage of \textbf{Kubernetes} is that it can detect a note out of order and initialize and deploy a new one to stay the optimal performance

"It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.
Kubernetes builds upon \textit{15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google} \cite{kubernetesArticle}, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community."\cite{kubernetes}
Thanks to these experiences, \textbf{Kubernetes} is a fine grain, and the cluster hierarchy is merely maintainable.

"Though widespread interest in software containers is a relatively recent phenomenon, at Google we have been managing Linux containers at scale for more than ten years and built three different container-management systems in that time."\cite{kubernetesArticle}
How you can see, the idea of containerization has a rich history.
However, there were \textbf{Linux Containers} before the \textbf{docker} ones.
That is the reason why we use it for web development.
It is easy to scale, maintain, and able to deploy to \textbf{Google Cloud Platform}.
