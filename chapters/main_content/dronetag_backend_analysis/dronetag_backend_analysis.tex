It is the easiest way to develop and publish new version software.
Thanks to docker compose tool we can have a separated parts of the infrastructure.
In case of bigger changes, we have to change only one and others are without changes.

In additional determination, this infrastructure is divided to Staging and Production environment.
Staging is for development and testing purposes and it usually runs on the same version as Production.
The exception is only when a new feature is establishing.
