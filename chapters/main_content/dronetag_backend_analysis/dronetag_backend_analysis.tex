\chapter{Dronetag web infrastructure}\label{ch:dronetag-web-infrastructure}
This chapter describes all Dronetag web infrastructure and contains a detailed description of the web Dronetag platform.
It consists of the all technical stack that ensures data providing.
We had to determine a convenient and reliable way of how to construct a useful architecture of infrastructure gradually.
It starts with an IoT module and frontend web client written in JavaScript, and it continues to implement WebSockets with alone Live Service based on a Kubernetes cluster.
Current parts of the stack are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Load Balancer,
    \item OLP Message Broker,
    \item Message Queue,
    \item Backend,
    \item Frontend,
    \item Private API endpoint,
    \item Public API endpoint,
    \item Database Storage and
    \item Live Service.
\end{itemize}
The components and their relations are showed on the infrastructure diagram~\ref{fig:infrastracture-diagram}.
I must note the stack is being still involved anytime when we find out it is insufficient and complexity of the all system increasing.

\section{API separation}\label{sec:api-separation}
Due to security reasons, the web API divides into \textbf{Private} and \textbf{Public API} endpoints.
\textbf{Public API} is allowed to use by third-party consumers.

In further determination, this infrastructure divides into the \textbf{Staging} and \textbf{Production} environment.
Staging is for development and testing purposes, and it usually runs on the same version as Production.
Production is like a mirror of Staging.
The difference is that the Production environment contains a previous version of the software that is released.
