\chapter{Software architecture and design}\label{ch:software-architecture-and-design}
This chapter describes a software architecture and design of the mobile application.
At the beginning, let me clarify the difference between the software architecture and design.
In Software development, Software architecture means the design of application from the higher perspective than Software design.
In opposite, Software design means the division of the code into parts that describe implementation details closely.
It means that when you start with new application project, it is important to arrange the project into small alone parts.
These parts should meet the encapsulation and comprehensive rule.

Libraries offering generics classes that include already implemented logic help to simplify and do code more readable thanks to the standards.
For better understanding, I will describe it on the following example.

The architecture usually means a division into bigger self-driven parts.
Typically, there are the concepts like MVC (Model-View-Controller) or their extended descendents like MVP (Model-View-Presenter) or MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel).
The newer famous concept in Flutter is Bloc.
I have already explained what the Bloc is in the chapter~\ref{ch:flutter-analysis} Flutter Analysis, so I will not clarify it anymore.
