\subsection{JsonSerializable}\label{subsec:jsonserializable-classes}
\textbf{Json Serializable} interface offers generating methods for serialization and deserialization classes.
\textbf{Json Annotation} annotates these classes.
These classes are converted, and the process creates the methods via the \textbf{build runner} library.
The advantage is that a developer must not code these methods by hand.
He can re-generated every time it is needed to change the class structure.

\textbf{Request classes} are used for store and serialization of data before the Rest client will send it.
This directory contains only \textbf{Login Request} and \textbf{Register Request} classes.

\textbf{Response classes} are used for store and deserialization of data after the Rest client has received it.
This directory contains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Aircraft Detail Response - is used for passing aircraft data in Aircraft Repository,
    \item Aircraft Overview Response - is used for a nested object in Flight Info Response in Flight Repository,
    \item Api Error - is used for processing of API error message in each of Repositories,
    \item Device Detail Response - is used for passing device data in Device Repository,
    \item Device Live Response - is used for passing device live data in Device Repository,
    \item Device Telemetry Response - is used for passing device telemetry live data in Device Repository,
    \item Dronetag Overview Response - is used for a nested object in Flight Info Response in Flight Repository,
    \item Flight Info Response - is used for passing flight data in Flight Repository,
    \item Flight Statistics Response - is used for flight statistics data in Flight Repository,
    \item Location - is used for passing latitude and longitude data in almost each of Repositories,
    \item Region Response - is used for a nested object in Zone Response and Flight Info Response,
    \item Take Off Response - is used for a nested object in Flight Info Response in Flight Repository,
    \item Telemetry Response - is used for passing telemetry data in Device Repository,
    \item User Profile Response - is used for passing user data in User Repository,
    \item Zone Response - is used for passing zone data in Zone Repository.
\end{itemize}
