\section{Software architecture}\label{sec:software-architecture}
This section focuses on the architecture of this application.
On the other hand, I would like to devote to talk about the difference between common \textbf{Bloc} and its extended class \textbf{Hydrated Bloc}.
Both of them using the sink and the stream concept working on the stream subscription principle.
The Hydrated bloc offers a persistent storage storing and loading with \textit{fromJson} and \textit{toJson} methods.
It helps to have an application working more fluently than alone loading data via the network every time when a user needs them.
