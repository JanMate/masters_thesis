\section{Software architecture}\label{sec:software-architecture}
This section focuses on the architecture of this application.
On the other hand, I would like to devote to talk about the difference between common Bloc and its extended class Hydrated Bloc.
Both of them using the sink and the stream concept working on the stream subscription principle.
The Hydrated bloc offers a persistent storage storing and loading with fromJson and toJson methods.
It helps to have an application working more fluently than alone loading data via the network every time when a user needs them.

In opposite, Software design means the division of the code into parts that describe implementation details closely.
