\subsection{Bloc and Hydrated Bloc}\label{subsec:bloc-and-hydrated-bloc}
In the beginning, we counted on all of BLoCs will be the classic one.
After short time, we have found out the storable concept is more convenient for this purpose.
So, some following we changed to descendants of HydratedBloc.
We have created a list of the following Bloc classes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User Profile Bloc,
    \item Aircraft Operation Bloc,
    \item Device Operation Bloc,
    \item Flight Operation Bloc,
    \item TODO
\end{itemize}

At the beginning, \textbf{User Profile Bloc} had extended from common Bloc but after increasing data traffic we decided to change it to Hydrated Bloc.
The reason is simple.
User properties do not change so often.
Due to it better to store the data in phone and update them when it changes.
User Profile bloc ensures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item fetching user data,
    \item log in user,
    \item sign up user,
    \item saving JWT token,
    \item
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Aircraft Operation Bloc}
%TODO: add description
Bloc ensures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Device Operation Bloc}
%TODO: add description
Bloc ensures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Flight OperationBloc}
%TODO: add description
Bloc ensures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
\end{itemize}


\subsection{JsonSerializable classes}\label{subsec:jsonserializable-classes}
Json Serializable interface offers generating of  methods for serialization and deserialization classes that are annotated by Json Annotation.
These classes are converted and created the methods via the \textbf{build runner} library.
The advantage is a developer must not code these methods by hand, and he can re-generated every time it is needed to change the class structure.

\textbf{Request classes}
%TODO

\textbf{Response classes}
%TODO


\subsection{Dio class}\label{subsec:dio-class}
Due to need of using Interception and fill prepared HTTP requests with Authentication Bearer we defined our a custom \textbf{Dronetag Dio} class.
It initializes \textbf{Pretty Dio Logger} to make clear debug printing and Token Interceptor that extends \textbf{Interceptors Wrapper}.
