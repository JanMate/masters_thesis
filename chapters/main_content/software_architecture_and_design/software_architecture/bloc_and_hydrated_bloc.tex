\subsection{Bloc and Hydrated Bloc}\label{subsec:bloc-and-hydrated-bloc}
In the beginning, it was counted on all of BLoCs (Business Logic Component) will have been the descendants of Bloc.
After a short time, it has been found out that the Hydrated Bloc storable pattern is more convenient for this purpose.
So, some Bloc classes were changed to descendants of HydratedBloc.
It has been created a list of the following classes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User Profile Bloc,
    \item Authentication Bloc,
    \item Aircraft Operation Bloc,
    \item Device Operation Bloc,
    \item Flight Operation Bloc,
    \item Device Detail Bloc,
    \item Location Bloc,
    \item Map Bloc,
    \item Map Zone Bloc,
    \item Map Drone Bloc,
    \item Map Place Bloc.
\end{itemize}
In the beginning, \textbf{User Profile Bloc} had extended common Bloc, but after increasing data traffic, it has changed to Hydrated Bloc.
The reason is simple.
User properties are not changed so often.
Due to it is better to store the data on the phone and update them when it changes.
User Profile bloc ensures loading and updating user data.

\textbf{Authentication Bloc} extends Bloc and ensures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Logging in a user,
    \item Logging out user,
    \item Finding out if a user is logged in.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Aircraft Operation Bloc} extends Hydrated Bloc and ensures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Loading aircraft data,
    \item Adding new aircraft,
    \item Updating an aircraft,
    \item Deleting an aircraft.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Device Operation Bloc} extends Hydrated Bloc and ensures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Loading device data,
    \item Registration of a device to a user,
    \item Updating a device,
    \item Deleting a device.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Flight Operation Bloc} extends Hydrated Bloc and ensures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Loading flight statistics data,
    \item Loading flights data,
    \item Loading flight data,
    \item Updating a flight,
    \item Deleting a flight.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Device Detail Bloc} extends Bloc and ensures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Switching Battery icon,
    \item Switching LTE icon,
    \item Switching Bluetooth icon.
\end{itemize}
This Bloc is used for switching of icons in the Device detail screen.

\textbf{Location Bloc} extends Hydrated Bloc and ensures focusing to a user location by GPS coordinates in the Dashboard map.

\textbf{Map Bloc} extends Bloc.
Map Bloc is the most complex component in the whole project.
It looks after all user interaction with the Dashboard map.
Map Bloc mediates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Loading zones,
    \item Finding all zones covering a given point,
    \item Showing and closing zone selection,
    \item Showing and closing zone detail,
    \item Loading flying drones,
    \item Showing and closing drone detail,
    \item Focusing on a drone location,
    \item Showing and closing place detail,
    \item Focusing to a place location,
    \item Pinning and unpinning place marker into the map,
    \item Storing map object like Markers, Circles, Polygons and Polylines.
\end{itemize}

\newpage

In addition, it has nested Blocs that listen the State changes.
These Blocs are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Map Zone Bloc,
    \item Map Drone Bloc,
    \item Map Place Bloc.
\end{itemize}
These Blocs react on the Map Bloc State changes, which means when a new State is created, a nested Bloc catches it and generate its new Event.
The Event ensures the real action on the level of the nested Bloc thanks to mapping methods.

\textbf{Map Zone Bloc} extends Bloc and ensures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Loading zones,
    \item Finding all zones covering a given point,
    \item Showing and closing zone selection,
    \item Showing and closing zone detail.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Map Drone Bloc} extends Bloc and ensures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Loading flying drones,
    \item Showing and closing drone detail,
    \item Focusing on a drone location.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Map Place Bloc} extends Bloc and ensures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Showing and closing place detail,
    \item Focusing on a place location,
    \item Pinning and unpinning place marker into the map.
\end{itemize}
